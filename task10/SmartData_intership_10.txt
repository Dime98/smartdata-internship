### SmartData intership ###

## Task nr. 10 ##

Hello! How are you? Hopw you had a lovely weekend and now you are ready for new challanges
towards data science learning.
So, today you will take a closer look to a very important term for the analyze part in 
data science: correlation.

## Tasks for training correlation concept ##
1. Import the House Sales in King County, USA dataset as Pandas dataframe: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction
2. Analyze the dataset
3. Make some preliminarily conclusions on the analyzed data.
4. Output the correlations between columns.
5. Analyze more in details the correlation between some selected columns that seem to carry
some valuable information.
6. Analyze the difference between corelation and cause-effect relationship and note the 
columns for both categories.
7. Make some modifications you consider to be suitable
8. Come up with some concluions (over the data set,in general, and/or business proposals, etc.)

deleted 'zipcode', 'lat', 'long' columns for now, I'll reimport data and bypass the cell if I'd need this columns.

converted 'date' column values to_datetime instead of str.

after plotting correlation heatmap made noticed that 'sqft_living' and 'sqft_above' have strong correlation .88
that tells that the living space is mostly not the the 1st floor.

printed the oldest and newest houses, oldest houses was buit in 1900 and there are 87 of them in this dataset.
also the priciest house (7_700_000.0) was build in 1910 (and renovated in 1987).

got correlation as dictionary that's sorted by correlation value for more readability (easier for me to read).
'sqft_living' parameter has the strongest correlation against 'price' (0.702) and 'grade' (0.762).

also got correlation of 'condition' against 'price' and 'grade' but the correlation is weak.
I expected correlation to be stronger.

ploted 'yr_built' and 'grade', noticed that newer houses tend have better grade.

remembered I did LinearRegression in university so I tied to do it for this dataset too.

added values of 'sqft_lot', 'sqft_living', 'sqft_above', 'sqft_basement' to new column in dataframe.
neither 'price' nor 'grade' are heavily affected by new sqft_total column.

when plotting 'condition' against 'grade' noticed that houses with better condition have 
better grade, which is expectable.

got the chapest house with highest grade, here are its stats:
	id			7237501190
	date			2014-10-10 00:00:00
	price			1780000.0
	bedrooms		4
	bathrooms		3.25
	sqft_living		4890
	sqft_lot		13402
	floors			2.0
	waterfront		0
	view			0
	condition		3
	grade			13
	sqft_above		4890
	sqft_basement		0
	yr_built		2004
	yr_renovated		0
	sqft_living15 		5790
	sqft_lot15		13539
	sqft_total		23182


as business proposals I can suggest to look at living area (sqft_living), grade of the house, 
the existance of more than 1 floor and number of bathrooms if the goal is money. (e.g: proposal for real estate)
also the previous point could be uses for those who want to buy a house with higher grade at a lower price.
