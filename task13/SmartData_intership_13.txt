## Task nr. 13 ##

Hello! Are you excited of today's task? So, today you are gonna analyze and make some 
conclusions on the provided data! Of course, you are free to use whatever tools you want
and perform the tasks you consider appropiriate to get a better overview on the dataset!

## Tasks for dataset analysis ##
1. Import the Chronic Kidney Disease dataset as Pandas dataframe: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mansoordaku/ckdisease
2. Analyze the dataset
3. Make some preliminarily conclusions on the analyzed data
4. Perform some modifications you consider appropiriate on the dataset
5. Come up with some conclusions on the gained information
6. Come up with some observations to help medical workers to identify faster the group
of risk of people to have kidney diseases.

after looking at data noticed some column should be labeled
['rbc', 'pc', 'pcc', 'ba', 'htn', 'dm', 'cad', 'appet', 'pe', 'ane', 'classification'].
before that fixed columns with '\t'.

replaced all nan using SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')

did LinearRegression preditction with 0.72 acurracy for test_size=.3, I get 0.82 for test_size=.1.
highest coefficient has 'sg' column with value of 27.58 followed by 'ane': 0.1 and 'cad': 0.08.
Although I managed to print confusion_matrix for Linear Regression but now gives an err, didn't know what I changed.
y_pred isn't y_pred isn't binary.

with LogisticRegression I get ConvergenceWarning if I go max_iter=1050.
tried to scale data, but it did't work so just increased max_iter.
Logistic Regression score is 0.975.
here is confusion_matrix:
array([[144,   5],
       [  1,  90]], dtype=int64)
