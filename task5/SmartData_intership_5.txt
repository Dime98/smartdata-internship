### SmartData intership ###

## Task nr. 5 ##

Hi! What a wonderfuuul day, right? Also add the fact that it's Friday ( :) )! It means 
it's already a week since your intership has started!!
Long story short. Today is a day to study one of the most powerful tools a data scientist 
can operate with: MATPLOTLIB. Why is it so? Because it is crucial in this job to have a 
graphical and visual representation of whatever we try to analyze. Of course, numbers are
good, but colourful plots are better!

## Tasks for introduction to MATPLOTLIB ##
(please do them in a Jupyter Notebook file with outputs shown)

1. Write a program to plot two or more lines with legends, different widths, styles
and colors.

2. Write a program to plot several lines with different format styles in one 
command using numpy arrays.

3.  Write a program to display the grid and draw line charts of the closing value 
of Alphabet Inc. between October 3, 2016 to October 7, 2016. Customized the grid lines 
with linestyle -, width .5. and color blue.
Data:
Date,Close
03-10-16,772.559998
04-10-16,776.429993
05-10-16,776.469971
06-10-16,776.859985
07-10-16,775.080017

4. Keep the graphic obtained in the previous exercise. Customized the grid lines with 
rendering with a larger grid (major grid) and a smaller grid (minor grid).Turn on the 
grid but turn off ticks.

5. Create multiple plots, such that your output has two rows: one plot in the first row and
four plots in the second one.

6. Write a program to display a bar chart of the popularity of programming 
Languages.
Data:
Programming languages: Java, Python, PHP, JavaScript, C#, C++
Popularity: 22.2, 17.6, 8.8, 8, 7.7, 6.7

7. Keep the program and data from the previous exercise. Change your program such that
the bars in the plot are placed horizontally.

8. Keep the data and the program from the previous exercise. Perform it in such a way
that there is grid on the background and specify the position for each bar plot. specify
the wifth of each bar.

9. Write a program to create bar plot of scores by group and gender. Use multiple X 
values on the same chart for men and women.
Data:
Sample Data:
Means (men) = (22, 30, 35, 35, 26)
Means (women) = (25, 32, 30, 35, 29)

10. Write a program to add textures (black and white) to bars and wedges. Use the 
data from previous exercise.

11. Write a program to create a pie chart of gold medal achievements of five most 
successful countries in 2016 Summer Olympics.
Data:
country,gold_medal
United States,46
Great Britain,27
China,26
Russia,19
Germany,17

12. Write a program to draw a scatter graph taking a random distribution in 
X and Y (200 values) and plotted against each other. Personalize the scetter plot by adding shape, 
dimenssion and color.

13. Write a program to represent the Poisson Probability for n values of X in range [0; 100].

14. Plot mean and standard deviation of the given dataset.
Dataset:
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'insert': [0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0],
    'mean': [0.009905, 0.45019, 0.376818, 0.801856, 0.643859],
    'quality': ['good', 'good', 'poor', 'good', 'poor'],
    'std': [0.003662, 0.281895, 0.306806, 0.243288, 0.322378]})

15. Do ex 15 from Task nr. 4.
