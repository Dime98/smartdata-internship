## Task nr. 2 ##

Hello and welcome to the new assignment within your internship stage! 
I hope you were pleased enough with the previous task because more interesting things are waiting to be discovered! 
The current assignment will focus on developing your Python skills and algorithmic thinking.
So, let's begin!

## Tasks for developing Python skills ##

1. Write a program to compute the sum of the two input values. If the two values are the 
same, then return triple their sum.

2. Write a program that checks two given integers and returns true if at least one of 
them is 30 or if their sum is 30. In other words, if either of the two integers is 30 or 
if their sum equals 30, the program will return true.

3. Write a program that checks if three given integers are in the range of 20 to 50 
(inclusive) and returns true if at least one of them is within the range. If none of the 
integers are within the range, the program returns false.
4. Write a program to check whether the sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3 appears in a given 

array of integers somewhere.

5. Write a program to reverse a given array of integers of length 5.

6. Using cycles, print following:
a)*		         b) * * * * *	    c)        *	       d) * * * * *       e)       *
  * *		          * * * *               * *             * * * *              * * *
  * * *		        * * *		            * * *               * * *            * * * * *
  * * * *	  	    * *		            * * * *		              * *		       * * * * * * *
  * * * * *	      *		            * * * * *		                *  	     * * * * * * * * *


7. Generate a multiplication table for all numbers from 1 to 10.

8. Given two sets of favorite video games of two students, return 
the intersection set of them.

9. Calculate the euclidean distance between two points in the space given 
their coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).

10. Given a number n create a list with first n fibonacci numbers.

11. Create a function that will return how many work days there are until the weekend, given
the current day. 

12. Create a function that will return the age of a person given their date of birth. Consider
the current date as the date to count to.

13. Read a list of numbers from a file, add to each number a value such that in the end they
will be sorted ascendantly. Save new numbers into the same file.

15. Given a binary array, find the index of 0 to be replaced with 1 to get the maximum length 
sequence of continuous ones.

16. Given an array of positive integers, find the smallest subarray's length whose sum of 
elements is greater than a given number k.

17. Find the maximum amount of water that can be trapped within a given set of bars where 
each bar's width is 1 unit (photo attached).

18. Given an unlimited supply of coins of given denominations, find the minimum number of 
coins required to get the desired change.

19. Write a program that given 3 different dictionaries will concatenate them and create 
new one.

20. Write a function that would rotate a list n places to the left.

21. Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst a list of
strings.

22. Write a function to calculate the prime factorization of an integer.

23. Create a pair of functions to encode and decode strings using the Caesar cipher.

24. Write a function that, given a dictionary, would translate a sentence. Words
not found in the dictionary need not be translated.
dictionary = {
 " mama ": " mother " ,
 " papa ": " father "
 }
5 original_string = " mama is with papa "
6 translator ( dictionary , original_string ) -> " mother is with father "

25. White a function that, given an array of strings, would group the anagrams
together.

26. Given an undirected graph, print all Hamiltonian paths present in it. 
The Hamiltonian path in an undirected or directed graph is a path that visits each vertex 
exactly once.

27. Given a positive number n, efficiently generate binary numbers between 1 and n in 
linear time.

28. Given a binary tree, check if it is a sum tree or not. In a sum tree, each non-leaf 
node's value is equal to the sum of all elements present in its left and right subtree. 
The value of a leaf node can be anything and the value of an empty child node is 
considered to be 0.

29. Given an integer array, find out the minimum and maximum element present using minimum 
comparisons.

30. Given an M x N integer matrix, print it in spiral order.
Input:
[  1   2   3   4  5 ]
[ 16  17  18  19  6 ]
[ 15  24  25  20  7 ]
[ 14  23  22  21  8 ]
[ 13  12  11  10  9 ]
 
Output:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

31. Given a balanced expression that can contain opening and closing parenthesis, check 
if it contains any duplicate parenthesis or not.
Input:  ((x+y))+z
Output: true
Explanation: Duplicate () found in subexpression ((x+y))
Input:  (x+y)
Output: false
Explanation: No duplicate () is found

32. Given a string, find the maximum length contiguous substring of it that is also a 
palindrome. For example, the longest palindromic substring of "bananas" is "anana", and 
the longest palindromic substring of "abdcbcdbdcbbc' is "bdcbcdb".

33. Given a line of text, reverse the text without reversing the individual words.

34. Given a set of single-digit positive numbers, find all possible combinations of words 
formed by replacing the continuous digits with corresponding character in the English 
alphabet, i.e., subset {1} can be replaced by A, {2} can be replaced by B, {10} can be 
replaced by J, {21} can be replaced by U, etc.

35. Create a python package that will store some random functions (you decide what to 
write, at least 5), import them into another python file and use them.
