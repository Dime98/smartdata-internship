deleted 'Unnamed: 0' column
rearanged columns so that 'Total Volume' and 'AveragePrice' would be at the end.

added new column 'Profit' that contains product of 'Total Volume' * 'AveragePrice'.

converted data to datetime and printed heat correlation map.
preliminary observations 'Total Volume' has the strongest correlation with:
'PLU_4046'	: 0.97
'PLU_4225'	: 0.97
'Total Bags'	: 0.96
'PLU_4770'	: 0.87
and the strongest correlation with new column 'Profit' is:
'Total Bags' 	: 0.96
'PLU_4225' 	: 0.95
'PLU_4046' 	: 0.95
'PLU_4770' 	: 0.83

grouped data by reqion and printed top and bottom seller regions.
top 5 selling regions:
	California      1.121414e+09
	West            1.066834e+09
	Northeast       9.600079e+08
	SouthCentral    8.740593e+08
	Southeast       7.036306e+08
top 5 low selling regions:
	Syracuse      	1.520519e+07
	Boise         	1.534667e+07
	Spokane       	1.715649e+07
	Louisville    	1.749555e+07
	Albany        	2.176672e+07
the top 1 best selling is 'TotalUS' so I ommited that.

made some plots with data grouped by year.
plots show that total volume is constanly growing except for year 2018,
I think it's because there data for only 3 months, all other years hava data for the whole year
wanted to plot difference between conventional and organic but is [1, 0, 2, 0] for years 2015-2018.


printed out how many unique values each column has.
'type' has 2 and 'year' 4, will leave 'year' as is but change 'type' to labeled (0/1).
also 'region' will also be label encoded.

deleted 'Small Bags', 'Large Bags', 'XLarge Bags' as there already is 'Total Bags' column.
