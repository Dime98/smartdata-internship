## Task nr. 11 ##

Hello!! How is it going? Hope you are still as enthusiastic in the beginning!
Today, there would be a more interesting assignment to complete because it is about a 
case study.

## Case Study ##

You are a Data Scientist at a popular IT company in the Republic of Moldova. Your name is
well known within the country and abroad day. One day, the CEO of a cardistributor company
in Poland, wrote you to ask your help in increasing the income of its business. You found
out that the company is preparing to aquire a new lot of cars. Analyzing the provided data,
you should come up with a list of cars or types of cars the company shoud purchase to
maximase its income.

## Tasks for case study ##
1. Import the Car Prices, Poland dataset as Pandas dataframe: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aleksandrglotov/car-prices-poland
2. Analyze the dataset
3. Make some conclusions on the dataset.
4. What influences car prices the most? What cars are more likely aquired by the client?

found 30085 null values in 'generation_name'

deleted "Unnamed: 0" column

plotted heatmap correlation between numeric values of dataFrame: 'year', 'mileage', 'vol_engine', 'price'.
'price' is most affected by 'year' followed by 'vol_engine'

added some new column when after studying 'milage' column.
I think that there are some strange values.
column I added are  ['age', 'miles_per_year', 'kilometers', 'kilometers_per_year']
here are some of top milage cars:
	ford	tourneo-connect	(2008) 		2_800_000 miles  4_506_163 km ||  2_800_000 mi per year	 321_868.80 km per year
	ford	mondeo		(2014)		2_500_000 miles  4_023_360 km ||  2_500_000 mi per year  502_920.00 km per year
	volkswagen	amarok	(2021)		1_000_000 miles  1_609_344 km ||  1_000_000 mi per year  1609_344.00 km per year
	volkswagen	golf	(2018)		1_000_000 miles  1_609_344 km ||  1_000_000 mi per year  402_336.00 km per year
	bmw	seria-3		(2005) 		999_999   miles  1_609_342 km ||  58_823.47 mi per year  94_667.20  km per year
there are some utility car in top 10 with huge mileages but all of them are believable.
especially volkswagen amarok 2021, 1_000_000 miles in a year, doubt it.
7 out of top 15 are van these type of cars are more likely to have high milage because there is a high change that these cars are used for bussines and/or governamental jobs.
the '67 ford mustang 999_999 miles 1_609_342 is more believable giving its age of 55.
also the price on these million miles car is insane, for example the 2nd top car in this list
ford mondeo (2014) 4_023_360 km for 23_800 (I assume euros), you could get a new one for $30k-38k

decideed to switch to goolgle colab when plt.bar(df["age"], df['mileage']) was taking little too long to plot.
noticed that google colab catches more isnull() values, it gets 1 for 'fuel', 'city', 'province', 'price'.
also for 'generation_name' i get 30085 while colab says there are 6277


business proposal:
here are top 4 most sold car manufacturers:
	audi          12031 units sold
	opel          11914 units sold
	bmw           11070 units sold
	volkswagen    10848 units sold
and top 4 least sold cars:
	mitsubishi    1120 units sold
	mini          1088 units sold
	alfa-romeo     704 units sold
	chevrolet      608 units sold

printed out what models is the best and worst selling for every car manufacturer
stored top 3 models for each manufacturer into a tabel. 
data is sorted, 1st column is the best selling, last the least selling.

printed the most selling car per 'city'
# found that there is one '()' value in 'city' column and '(' for 'province'

got the best selling by 'model' and 'generation_name' for each car manufacturer
also did it for 'model' and 'fuel'

also noticed that there are 'vol_engine' = 0
when printed 'vol_engine' = 0 first results where for electric type of 'fuel'.
so I thought that dataset didn't include kilowatts for electric cars, however there were some diesel entries.
