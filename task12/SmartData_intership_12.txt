>>
noticed abnormal values for 'systolic', 'diastolic' so replace outliers with columns mean().

got acknowledged with feature selection and tried some algorithms.
methods I used:
Pearson’s correlation coefficient
Spearman’s rank coefficient
VarianceThreshold
Information Gain
Chi-square Test
Mean Absolute Difference (MAD)
Lasso
Random Forest Importance
Forward Feature Selection
