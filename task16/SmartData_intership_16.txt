## Task nr. 16 ##

Hii!! How's it going? Today we will start an interesting topic: introduction into some basic ML
algorithms that will help you (I hope) to analyze data in the future. Today's topic is Linear
Regression.

## Tasks for Linear Regression ##
1. Import the Used Car Data dataset as Pandas dataframe: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjeetsinghnaik/used-car-information
2. Analyze the dataset and determine the target column
3. Study the correlation between features and find the features subset 
with the highest correlation with the target column absolute correlation (between 0.5 and 0.8)
4. Split the data into 2 sub-sets using the train_test_split function from sklearn
5. Train a sklearn Linear Regression model on the data with selected columns (train subset).
6. Test the model 
7. Come up with some conclusions on the obtained accuracy. How can it be improved or what can 
you change in the chosen approach such that running the algorithm you obtain a better accuracy?
P.S. Don't forget to comment the code
