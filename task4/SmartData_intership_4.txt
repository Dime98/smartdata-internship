## Task nr. 4 ##

Hello! Hope you interested in previous tasks as it aimed to form and develop you baisic 
skills!
In terms of today's assignment, it will be more exciting (at least in my opinion and hope
you will agree with me), as it requires work on a real dataset. We will start with ones of 
the most popular (and legendary) datasets. We are talking about  "Iris Species" datase from 
Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris). To perform this task, you will need to
apply the skills gathered in the previous days.

## Tasks for basic dataset analysis ##
1. Go to the Kagle dataset page (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris) and download
the specified dataset.

2. Create a Jupyter Notebook file.

3. Import the dataset as a dataframe.

4. Get some simple statistical information about the dataset (using describe()).

5. Output the first 5 rows from the dataset to study its structure.

6. Get the general information of the dataset fields, such as the number of non-null values
and the type of data (one function).

7. Display first ten entities with the value of "Species" set to "setoasa".

8. Display last ten entities with the value of "Species" set to "versicolor".

9. Create a NumPy array with entities of spice "Virginica".

10. Display the percentage of each spice in the dataset.

11. Determine which Spice, on average, has the larger value of "Sepal.Length".

12. Determine which Spice, on average, has the lowest value of "Petal.Width".

13. Plot the average value of each spice "Sepal.Width" in one schema.

14. Compare Petal Length and Petal Width of each spice using a graph (plot the values 
with individual color for each color, where x axis is "Petal.Length" and y axis is 
"Petal.Width").

15. Extract only enteties with Petal.Length greater than the average Petal.Length.
