### SmartData intership ###

## Task nr. 7 ##

Hello! Hope you are great and yet in forces to continue your training process during this
intership! Can you guess what today's topic is going to be about? 
So, long story short: have you ever faced situations when, providing some data, there
are some instance that are considerably different from others? But... can it be a 
problem? Of course it can! Imagine the situation when you are trying to predict the mean 
value of a column where most of the values are between 0 and 10 and only two of them are 
greater than 1000. What will happen in this case?
So, today's topic is about outlier detection.

## Tasks for outliers detection ##

1. Create a Jupyter Notebook file.

2. Import the Pokemon Classification dataset as Pandas dataframe:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abcsds/pokemon.

3. Analyze the data set by viewing info about it, types of data number of missing values, 
and so on.

4. Prepare the dataset (For example, handle the NAN values).

5. Find the columns that have the greatest correlation with the target column (TOP 7) and
create a smaller dataset including only these columns and the target one.

6. Plot some semnificative data tha you consider relevant to be shown (at least 3). Defend
your choice.

7. Make some conclusions based on the plots.

8. Identify the number of outliers on the whole dataset (without the target column), using
different algorithms (at least 3).

9. For each outlier detection algorithm, plot a graphic and make some conclusions.

10. Modify the contamination value for each algorithm, plot thegraph of dependence of the
outliers number on it and make some cocnclusions.

11. Try to come up with some methods of outliers removing. Test your guesses and make some
relevant conclusions.

. Create a table that shows thenumber of outliers in dependence of the used algorithm. Try to
identify the most accurate one in your opinion.
