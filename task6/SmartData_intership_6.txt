### SmartData intership ###

## Task nr. 6 ##

Hi! How are you? Hope you like the intership here and discover something new for you!
So, today's topic will cover an important aspect in data science:the presence of missing 
values, in other words of parameters that have no data. Why do we need this? Sometimes
the absence of data (especially if there is a lot of data missing) may misslead the 
general view on the data and the conclusions we may extract from there.

## Tasks for dealing with null values ##
1. Create a Jupyter Notebook file.

2. Import the Boston House Prices dataset as Pandas dataframe:

3. Create a bar plot to show the number of missing values in each column.

4. Create an instance of SimpleImputer

5. Try different startegies of imputation of missing values of SimpleImputer instance to
deal with missing values. Show the result for each of them.

6. Create an instance of the SimpleImputer with the strategy set as constant and the 
fill_value=0.

7. Download and import "reparo library" (pip install reparo)

8. Create an instance of the CDI from reparo.
9. Create an instance of the FRNNI from reparo.

10. Create an instance of the HotDeckImputation from reparo.

11. Create an instance of the KNNImputer from reparo.

12. Create an instance of the PMM from reparo.

13. Create an instance of the SICE from reparo.

14. Create an instance of the MICE from reparo.

15. Train every imputer data set.

16. Choose the best imputer method (in your opinion) to do the final dataset with each
missing value filled.

17. Make conclusions on the results you got.
