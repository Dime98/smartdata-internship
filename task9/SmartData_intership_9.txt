## Task nr. 9 ##

Hi! How is it going? hope you were really interested and involved into the process of 
fully analyzing a dataset, given in the previous task! For today, you will continue your
work on an individual dataset. 
As a data scientist, you should be able analyze not only the given dataset itself, but
the probem described there itself and come with a business solution.
As your work for the previous task was pretty accurate, today we will extend the dataset
described there and will come with a new one, that combines red and white wine quality.

## Tasks for dataset analysis from business perspective ##
1. Import the Red Wine quality dataset as Pandas dataframe: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruthgn/wine-quality-data-set-red-white-wine
2. Analyze the dataset.
3. Make the statistical analysis of the given dataset (based on the whole dataset or 
specific columns) and explicitly describe your decisions.
4. Answer to the questions what columns impact the target column the most? Why is it
happening?
5. Come up with a business proposal for the owners of the company that provided data
(find link to their site in dataset description)such that they increse their wine sales.
Why did you come up with that specific decision? Based on the analyzed data, what influenced 
your decision?

separated white wine from red wine to analyze them separately.
	separated with df.value_counts().loc["red"] but while working on other cells 
	noticed that the number of elements was not corresponding to original dataFrame, 
	sorted_df.get_group("red") gave proper result
		raw_df.value_counts():
			white    4898
			red      1599

		sorted_df.value_counts().loc["white"].size)
		sorted_df.value_counts().loc["red"].size)
			white size   3961
			red size     1359
	even if the size is different the values for quality.mean() and alcohol.max()/mean() are the same

plotted correlation heatmap for each type of wine to visually identify correlation.
made a method to plot heatmap so that I'd use dry principle
'free sulfur dioxide' and 'total sulfur dioxide' have the highest positive correlation for both types of wine

plotted wine mean quality and and alcohol.
	white wine is leading with slightly better quality score 5.85 vs 5.62
	however there are significantly more entries for white wine 4898 vs 1599.
	highest alcohol values has the red wine 14.9, max aclohol for white is 14.2.

while getting correlation of 'alcohol' and components noticed that the top element with highest value 
is the same for both red and white, the component is 'pH'. correlation is pretty weak though .12 for both wines.
also 'sulphates' is the 3rd top element that infuluence alcohol for both types of wine but the correlation is near 0.

for 'quality' correlation, both wines have 'alcohol' as the top element, and 'sulphates' are in top 3.

just like in previous task, I got mean values for components that make the best quality wine.
made plot for white, red wine and for the whole dataset.
had to take max quality and subtract 1 because there's no red wine with quality 9.
